# C-demo
 
After CSC 111 at UVic ended, I failed to download my code in time so it was all deleted from the servers.  I created this project to practice implementing the concepts learned in the course, and create some files I can use as reference next time I work with C.
I began by creating a library with a variety of functions to implement, and a corresponding C file, as well as a main file with the main program loop.  I then attempted to implement every file, then went back and debugged each one individually.  I am currently working on debugging the main file's input loop.
This program uses dynamic memory allocation, file I/O, data structures, and abstraction, among other concepts.
